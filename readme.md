# Icon Items
This mod adds icons and logos from various websites and projects in item form into the game.
~~There's also some bribery item~~
These are all the icon items in a (messy) dropped form![banner](https://github.com/blryface/icon-items/blob/main/misc/assets-for-description/iconitemsthing.gif?raw=true)
These are all items in a nice little grid![jade-is-missing](https://github.com/blryface/icon-items/blob/main/misc/assets-for-description/iconitemsthing.png?raw=true)
